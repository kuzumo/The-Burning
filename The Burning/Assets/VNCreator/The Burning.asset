      vigilance. Elder Rynn, an imposing yet gentle presence, waited for the travelers.
      His silver-tipped feathers shimmered in the torchlight, his amber eyes reflecting
      the flames as though holding centuries of wisdom within them. A wooden staff,
      adorned with ancient runes and feathers from his ancestors, rested in his talons.

      oakwood wrapped around them like a long-lost embrace. A few weary patrons occupied
      the wooden tables, speaking in hushed tones. The innkeeper, a plump hare with
      fur tinged gray from years of hard work, greeted them with a forced smile.
